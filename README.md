# CodeQuiz_HW4
A timed quiz on random Formula 1 facts that stores the top 3 high scores in local storage.

## Purpose
The purpose of this homeowrk assignment was to create a timed quiz using JavaScript fundamentals (DOM manipulation, event listeners, functions, etc.) that dynamically updates the associated HTML/CSS and saves scores to local storage.

I chose to have mine feature random facts related to Formula 1!

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz

WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over

WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

## The bulk of the challenge
The main challenge for me in this assignment was to get all of the various functions working together properly, culminating in being able to save user scores.  

## End result
After much time and effort, my Formula 1 quiz is in an entirely functional state and saves the top three user scores to local storage.
